# PRODIGY MACHINE LAERNING TASK:01
 Hello All!I am really glad to be the part of Prodigy Infotech Machine Learning Internship.Here is the overview for the first Task . This process concentracts more on data loading ,data Preprocessing , Exploratotoray Data Analysis and model Building and model evaluation for the House Price Prediction dataset.
 
 ## PROBLEM STATMENT
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bathrooms and bedrooms

### ABOUT THE DATASET:
The dataset used here is the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques in Kaggle.
This dataset primarily helps us to Predict sales prices of the house. The dataset contains 1460 rows and 81 columns .The data have the important features about the House Price like :
SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that you're trying to predict.
MSSubClass: The building class
MSZoning: The general zoning classification
LowQualFinSF: Low quality finished square feet (all floors)
GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
BsmtFullBath: Basement full bathrooms
BsmtHalfBath: Basement half bathrooms
FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade
HalfBath: Half baths above grade
Bedroom: Number of bedrooms above basement level etc.

#### OVERWIEW OF MY WORK: 
Loaded necessary libraries and the dataset
Performed data preprocessing and cleaning
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using different charts
Built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms
The linear regression model has been trained and evaluated using the selected features: ground living area (GrLivArea), number of full bathrooms (FullBath), and number of bedrooms above ground (BedroomAbvGr).
The model's performance metrics (RMSE and R-squared) have been displayed, along with the coefficients for each feature and the intercept. 
Additionally, a scatter plot comparing the actual prices to the predicted prices has been generated to visualize the model's performance.
