# PRODIGY MACHINE LEARNING TASK:01

Hello All!

I am delighted to be part of the Prodigy Infotech Machine Learning Internship. Here is an overview of the first task, which focuses on data loading, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and model evaluation for the House Price Prediction dataset.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms.

### ABOUT THE DATASET:
The dataset used is the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques from Kaggle. This dataset is designed to help predict house sales prices. It contains 1460 rows and 81 columns, including key features relevant to house prices such as:

- SalePrice: The property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable to predict.
- MSSubClass: The building class.
- MSZoning: The general zoning classification.
- LowQualFinSF: Low quality finished square feet (all floors).
- GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
- BsmtFullBath: Basement full bathrooms.
- BsmtHalfBath: Basement half bathrooms.
- FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade.
- HalfBath: Half baths above grade.
- Bedroom: Number of bedrooms above basement level.

#### OVERVIEW OF MY WORK:
- Loaded necessary libraries and the dataset.
- Performed data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using various charts.
- Built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms.
- Trained and evaluated the linear regression model using the selected features: ground living area (GrLivArea), number of full bathrooms (FullBath), and number of bedrooms above ground (BedroomAbvGr).
- Displayed the model's performance metrics (RMSE and R-squared), along with the coefficients for each feature and the intercept.
- Generated a scatter plot comparing actual prices to predicted prices to visualize the model's performance.
